DIVERGENCE EVENT STUDY: EMPIRICAL RESULTS SUMMARY
================================================================================
Generated: 2026-01-09
Data: BTC daily sentiment (2024-01-01 to 2026-01-08, N=739 days)

METHODOLOGY
-----------
- Retail sentiment: Fear & Greed Index scaled to [-1, 1]
- Institutional sentiment proxy: Constructed from:
  * Volatility-implied sentiment (high vol = bearish)
  * Smoothed/lagged retail sentiment (7-day EMA)
  * Contrarian adjustment when price-sentiment correlation is negative
- Divergence = retail - institutional
- Events identified with min 5-day gap to avoid clustering
- Statistical tests: Newey-West HAC standard errors, bootstrap CIs

KEY FINDINGS
------------

1. FORWARD RETURNS (Table 1)

   Threshold  |  N   |  1-day  |  3-day  |  5-day  |  7-day
   -----------|------|---------|---------|---------|--------
   |div|>0.3  |  86  |  0.09%  |  0.54%  |  0.96%  |  1.18%
              |      |  (0.31) |  (1.34) |  (1.66) |  (1.65)
   |div|>0.4  |  68  |  0.26%  |  0.63%  |  1.40%**|  0.74%
              |      |  (0.74) |  (1.42) |  (2.14) |  (0.91)
   |div|>0.5  |  40  |  0.87%* |  0.59%  |  1.87%**|  1.92%**
              |      |  (2.01) |  (0.96) |  (2.57) |  (2.25)

   t-statistics in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.10

   INTERPRETATION: At high divergence levels (|div|>0.5), there are
   statistically significant positive abnormal returns of ~1.9% over
   5-7 days. This suggests divergence events may represent temporary
   mispricing that corrects over the subsequent week.


2. VOLATILITY COMPARISON (Table 2)

   Threshold  |  N   | During Div | Unconditional
   -----------|------|------------|---------------
   |div|>0.3  |  86  |   37.5%    |    36.0%
   |div|>0.4  |  68  |   38.6%    |    36.0%
   |div|>0.5  |  40  |   38.9%    |    36.0%

   INTERPRETATION: Volatility during divergence events is not
   significantly elevated compared to unconditional volatility.
   This does NOT support the hypothesis that divergence predicts
   volatility spikes. The ratio is only ~1.07x.


3. DIRECTIONAL ACCURACY

   Threshold  | Retail Correct | Institutional Correct
   -----------|----------------|----------------------
   |div|>0.3  |     45.3%      |        52.3%
   |div|>0.4  |     45.6%      |        55.9%
   |div|>0.5  |     40.0%      |        52.5%

   INTERPRETATION: Institutional sentiment proxy shows marginally
   better predictive accuracy than retail sentiment, especially at
   higher divergence thresholds. However, neither exceeds 56%,
   indicating limited practical predictive power.


4. DIRECTIONAL ASYMMETRY (threshold=0.4)

   When retail more bullish (n=18):
     - Mean 7d return: +1.75%
     - Positive outcome: 50.0%

   When institutional more bullish (n=50):
     - Mean 7d return: +0.37%
     - Positive outcome: 54.0%

   Difference test: t=0.79, p=0.434 (not significant)

   INTERPRETATION: No statistically significant difference in
   outcomes based on direction of divergence.


IMPLICATIONS FOR PAPER
----------------------

1. PARTIAL SUPPORT for divergence hypothesis:
   - YES: Significant abnormal returns at high divergence (supports
     the idea that divergence represents mispricing)
   - NO: Volatility not significantly elevated (does not support
     the volatility spike prediction)

2. INSTITUTIONAL SENTIMENT shows slightly better accuracy, but the
   margin is small and may not be economically meaningful.

3. The CAR plot (Panel A) shows a clear pattern: returns drift
   downward before events, then recover afterward, suggesting
   divergence identifies mean-reversion opportunities.

4. HONEST REPORTING: These are mixed results. The paper should
   acknowledge that:
   - The divergence-volatility link is not empirically supported
   - The return predictability is only significant at extreme
     divergence levels (|div|>0.5, n=40 events)
   - Sample size at extreme thresholds is limited

PAPER TEXT SUGGESTION
---------------------

"We empirically test the divergence hypothesis using 739 days of
Bitcoin sentiment data (2024-2026). Identifying divergence events
where |retail - institutional| exceeds various thresholds, we find
that extreme divergence (|div|>0.5) predicts statistically significant
positive abnormal returns of 1.9% over 5-7 days (t=2.25, p<0.05;
Table X). This suggests divergence may identify temporary mispricing
that subsequently corrects.

However, we do not find significantly elevated volatility during
divergence events (38.9% vs 36.0% unconditional), contrary to our
initial hypothesis. The institutional sentiment proxy shows marginally
better directional accuracy (52-56%) than retail sentiment (40-46%),
though neither demonstrates strong predictive power.

These results provide partial support for the multi-scale sentiment
architecture: while divergence between sentiment sources does appear
to capture pricing inefficiencies, the hypothesized link to volatility
spikes is not empirically validated."
